Babysitting Service DB Menagement - As part of my studies, I designed and developed a database management system for a babysitting service.
The project involved creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) with at least six entities, building a relational database in MySQL, and inserting sample data.
I wrote 12 SQL queries and implemented 4 DML/DDL commands to meet business requirements.
This project allowed me to apply my knowledge in database design, SQL, and business logic, while ensuring the system's efficiency in managing babysitting services.
